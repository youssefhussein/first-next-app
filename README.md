1. components are server side rendered by default
2. creating a get route is ez just add a new folder with the name of the route with a page.jsx file (hard to navigate the different files cuz theyre all called page.jsx)
3. tailwind is awesome
4. use className not class
5. next.js is a meta framework
6. building for production is slow
7.
